            A blind contour drawing is done by keeping one's eyes on the
            subject and not glancing at the paper. The idea is to
            concentrate on the minutiae and to be less concerned with the
            result. This drawing works well as the important parts of the
            plant are captured and less essential pieces are left to be
            filled in by the viewer.
        </p>

            Look at the relationship between the markings on the leaves and
            the edges: even though some of the dots wander outside the
            lines, the relationship still makes a certain amount of sense.
            Likewise, the shape of the pot is rough, but the scale and size
            are true enough and counter balance the detail given to the
            plant.

            Trying to accurately capture tone leaves some of my work feeling
            too busy. The sparseness of this drawing allows the important
            parts to pop and draws the viewers eye to the more interesting
            detail I was able to capture. This style of drawing helps train
            the eye to look for important parts of the subject.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what do I enjoy about this? Detail. Minutiae. Relationships.
            Prioritization. Sparseness.
