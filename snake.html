        <p>
            I'm not a reader of the Harry Potter books, but have read the
            last one in the series. Either from that book or the movies, I
            know about Parseltongue: but what is it really? Today someone
            pointed out that it was not a "language", but rather the ability
            to understand snakes and serpentia. Does that imply that while
            understanding snakes, Harry couldn't speak to them? Or that he
            could speak to them in English and through his magic the snake
            would understand in their language and vice versa. Or maybe
            snakes don't have the cognitive ability to even "speak" and that
            the magic was filling in what the snake would have said if
            snakes could talk.
        </p>

        <p>
            Really -- what would a snake say if it could talk? What would
            any animal say, really?
